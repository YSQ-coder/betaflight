**Overview**

# **1 Overview**

The LSM6DSK320X is a system-in-package IMU featuring a high-performance 3-axis digital low-*g* accelerometer, a 3-axis digital high-*g* accelerometer, and a 3-axis digital gyroscope.

The LSM6DSK320X delivers best-in-class motion sensing that can detect orientation and gestures in order to empower application developers and consumers with features and capabilities that are more sophisticated than simply orienting their devices to portrait and landscape mode.

The event-detection interrupts enable efficient and reliable motion tracking and context awareness, implementing hardware recognition of free-fall events, 6D orientation, click and double-click sensing, activity or inactivity, stationary/motion detection and wake-up events. Machine learning and finite state machine processing allow moving some algorithms from the application processor to the LSM6DSK320X sensor, enabling consistent reduction of power consumption.

The LSM6DSK320X supports the main OS requirements, offering real, virtual, and batch mode sensors. In particular, the LSM6DSK320X has been designed to implement hardware features such as significant motion detection, stationary/motion detection, tilt, pedometer functions, timestamping and to support the data acquisition of external sensors.

The LSM6DSK320X offers hardware flexibility to connect the pins with different mode connections to external sensors to expand functionalities such as adding a sensor hub, auxiliary SPI, and so forth.

The LSM6DSK320X offers advanced design flexibility for OIS and EIS applications. Both channels have a dedicated processing path with independent filtering and enhanced EIS channel gyroscope data are read over the primary interfaces I²C/ MIPI I3C® v1.1 / SPI.

Channel 1 has been designed for user interface data processing for motion tracking. Data are available on the primary output of I²C / SPI / I3C for the accelerometer and gyroscope with independent ODR and FS.

Channel 2 has been designed for OIS applications. Data are available on the auxiliary SPI or I3C at 7.68 kHz with accelerometer/gyroscope processing with independent FS at ±2 *g* to ±16 *g* (accelerometer) / ±250 dps to ±4000 dps (gyroscope). The accelerometer is also available as standalone with dedicated filtering.

Channel 3 has been designed for enhanced EIS. Data are available in free-run mode in the output registers or in FIFO with dedicated tag and timestamp.

Channel 4 has been designed for high-*g* applications with accelerometer processing with independent FS at ±32 *g* to ±320 *g*.

Up to 4.5 KB of FIFO with compression and dynamic allocation of significant data (that is, external sensors, timestamp, and so forth) allows overall power saving of the system.

The LSM6DSK320X embeds a sensor fusion low-power (SFLP) algorithm able to provide a 6-axis (accelerometer + gyroscope) game rotation vector represented as a quaternion. The X, Y, Z quaternion components are stored in FIFO.

Like the entire portfolio of MEMS sensor modules, the LSM6DSK320X leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

The LSM6DSK320X embeds advanced dedicated features like a finite state machine and data filtering for OIS, EIS, and motion processing.

The LSM6DSK320X is available in a small plastic, land grid array (LGA) package of 2.5 x 3.0 x 0.83 mm to address ultracompact solutions.

# **2.1 Pedometer functions: step detector and step counters**

The LSM6DSK320X embeds an advanced pedometer with an algorithm running in an ultralow-power domain in order to ensure extensive battery life in battery-constrained applications.

Leveraging enhanced configurability, the advanced embedded pedometer is suitable for a large range of applications from mobile to wearable devices.

The algorithm processes and analyzes the accelerometer waveform in order to count the user's steps during walking and running activities.

The pedometer works at 30 Hz and it is not affected by the selected device power mode (ultralow-power, lowpower, high-performance), thus guaranteeing an ultralow-power experience and extreme flexibility in conjunction with other device functionalities.

The pedometer output can be batched in the device's FIFO buffer, in order to decrease overall system supply current.

ST freely provides the support and the tools for easily configuring the device and tuning the algorithm configuration for a best-in-class user experience.

**DSxxxxx** - **Rev 0.1 page 4/210**

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**2.2 Pedometer algorithm**

The pedometer algorithm is composed of a cascade of four stages:

- 1. Computation of the acceleration magnitude signal in order to detect the signal independently from device orientation;
- 2. FIR filter to extract relevant frequency components and to smooth the signal by cutting off high frequencies;
- 3. Peak detector to find the maximum and minimum of the waveform and compute the peak-to-peak value;
- 4. Step count: if the peak-to-peak value is greater than the settled threshold, a step is counted.

**Figure 1. Four-stage pedometer algorithm**

![](_page_4_Figure_11.jpeg)

The LSM6DSK320X embeds a dynamic internal threshold for step detection that is updated after each peak-topeak evaluation: the internal threshold is increased with a configurable speed if a step is detected or decreased with a configurable speed if a step is not detected.

This approach ensures high accuracy when the user starts to walk and a false peak rejection when the user is walking or running.

An internal configurable debounce algorithm can be also set to filter false walks: indeed, an accelerometer pattern is recognized as a walk or run only if a minimum number of steps are counted.

The LSM6DSK320X has been designed to reject a false-positive signal inside the algorithm core.

On top of the mechanisms detailed above, the LSM6DSK320X allows enabling and configuring a dedicated falsepositive rejection block to further boost pedometer accuracy.

# **2.3 Tilt detection**

The tilt function helps to detect activity change and has been implemented in hardware using only the accelerometer to achieve targets of both ultralow power consumption and robustness during the short duration of dynamic accelerations.

The tilt function is based on a trigger of an event each time the device's tilt changes and can be used with different scenarios, for example:

- Triggers when a phone is in a front pants pocket and the user goes from sitting to standing or standing to sitting;
- Does not trigger when a phone is in a front pants pocket and the user is walking, running, or going upstairs.

# **2.4 Significant motion detection**

The significant motion detection (SMD) function generates an interrupt when a 'significant motion', that could be due to a change in user location, is detected. In the LSM6DSK320X device this function has been implemented in hardware using only the accelerometer.

SMD functionality can be used in location-based applications in order to receive a notification indicating when the user is changing location.

**Embedded low-power features**

# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**2.5 Finite state machine**

The LSM6DSK320X can be configured to generate interrupt signals activated by user-defined motion patterns. To do this, up to 8 embedded finite state machines can be programmed independently for motion detection such as glance gestures, absolute wrist tilt, shake and double-shake detection.

#### **Definition of finite state machine**

A state machine is a mathematical abstraction used to design logic connections. It is a behavioral model composed of a finite number of states and transitions between states, similar to a flow chart in which one can inspect the way logic runs when certain conditions are met. The state machine begins with a start state, goes to different states through transitions dependent on the inputs, and can finally end in a specific state (called stop state). The current state is determined by the past states of the system. The following figure shows a generic state machine.

**Figure 2. Generic state machine**

#### **Finite state machine in the LSM6DSK320X**

The LSM6DSK320X works as a combo accelerometer-gyroscope sensor, generating acceleration and angular rate output data. It is also possible to connect an external sensor like a magnetometer or pressure sensor by using the sensor hub feature (mode 2). These data can be used as input of up to 8 programs in the embedded finite state machine (Figure 3. State machine in the LSM6DSK320X).

All 8 finite state machines are independent: each one has its dedicated memory area and it is independently executed. An interrupt is generated when the end state is reached or when some specific command is performed.

**Figure 3. State machine in the LSM6DSK320X**

#### <span id="page-6-0"></span>**High-***g* **peak tracking feature**

The high-*g* accelerometer peak tracking feature allows monitoring the magnitude of the high-*g* accelerometer within a time window that can be defined by issuing dedicated commands from the finite state machine. When issuing the command related to the end of the monitoring window, this feature stores the high-*g* accelerometer three-axis components of the detected peak in the FIFO with a dedicated TAG.

# **2.6 Machine learning core**

The LSM6DSK320X embeds a dedicated core for machine learning processing that provides system flexibility, allowing some algorithms run in the application processor to be moved to the MEMS sensor with the advantage of consistent reduction in power consumption.

Machine learning core logic allows identifying if a data pattern (for example motion, pressure, temperature, magnetic data, and so forth) matches a user-defined set of classes. Typical examples of applications could be activity detection like running, walking, driving, and so forth.

The LSM6DSK320X machine learning core works on data patterns coming from the low-*g*, high-*g* accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, but it is also possible to connect and process external sensor data (like magnetometer or pressure sensor) by using the sensor hub feature (mode 2).

The input data can be filtered using a dedicated configurable computation block containing filters and features computed in a fixed time window defined by the user. Computed feature values and filtered data values can also be read through the FIFO buffer.

Machine learning processing is based on logical processing composed of a series of configurable nodes characterized by "if-then-else" conditions where the "feature" values are evaluated against defined thresholds.

**Figure 4. Machine learning core in the LSM6DSK320X**

The LSM6DSK320X can be configured to run up to 8 decision trees simultaneously and independently and every decision tree can generate up to 16 results. The total number of nodes can be up to 256.

The results of the machine learning processing are available in dedicated output registers readable from the application processor at any time.

The LSM6DSK320X machine learning core can be configured to generate an interrupt when a change in the result occurs.

# **2.7 Adaptive self-configuration (ASC)**

The LSM6DSK320X supports the adaptive self-configuration (ASC) feature, which allows the FSM to automatically reconfigure the device in real time based on the detection of a specific motion pattern or based on the output of a specific decision tree configured in the MLC, without any intervention from the host processor. The FSM can write a subset of the device registers using the SETR command, which allows indicating the register address and the new value to be written in such a register. The access to these device registers is mutually exclusive to the host.

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**2.8 Sensor fusion low power**

A sensor fusion low-power (SFLP) block is available in the LSM6DSK320X for generating the following data based on the (low-*g*) accelerometer and gyroscope data processing:

- Game rotation vector, which provides a quaternion representing the attitude of the device
- Gravity vector, which provides a three-dimensional vector representing the direction of gravity
- Gyroscope bias, which provides a three-dimensional vector representing the gyroscope bias

The SFLP block is enabled by setting the SFLP\_GAME\_EN bit to 1 of the [EMB\\_FUNC\\_EN\\_A \(04h\)](#page-127-0) embedded functions register.

The SFLP block can be reinitialized by setting the SFLP\_GAME\_INIT bit to 1 of the [EMB\\_FUNC\\_INIT\\_A \(66h\)](#page-151-0)  embedded functions register.

# **4.6 Terminology**

### **4.6.1 Sensitivity**

Linear acceleration sensitivity can be determined, for example, by applying 1 *g* acceleration to the device. Because the sensor can measure DC accelerations, this can be done easily by pointing the selected axis towards the ground, noting the output value, rotating the sensor 180 degrees (pointing towards the sky) and noting the output value again. By doing so, ±1 *g* acceleration is applied to the sensor. Subtracting the larger output value from the smaller one, and dividing the result by 2, leads to the actual sensitivity of the sensor. This value changes very little over temperature and over time. The sensitivity tolerance describes the range of sensitivities of a large number of sensors (see [Table 3](#page-11-0)).

An angular rate gyroscope is a device that produces a positive-going digital output for counterclockwise rotation around the axis considered. Sensitivity describes the gain of the sensor and can be determined by applying a defined angular velocity to it. This value changes very little over temperature and time (see [Table 3\)](#page-11-0).

### **4.6.2 Zero-***g* **and zero-rate level**

Linear acceleration zero-*g* level offset (TyOff) describes the deviation of an actual output signal from the ideal output signal if no acceleration is present. A sensor in a steady state on a horizontal surface measures 0 *g* on both the X-axis and Y-axis, whereas the Z-axis measures 1 *g*. Ideally, the output is in the middle of the dynamic range of the sensor (content of OUT registers 00h, data expressed as two's complement number). A deviation from the ideal value in this case is called zero-*g* offset.

Offset is to some extent a result of stress to the MEMS sensor and therefore the offset can slightly change after mounting the sensor onto a printed circuit board or exposing it to extensive mechanical stress. Offset changes little over temperature, see "Linear acceleration zero-*g* level change vs. temperature" in [Table 3](#page-11-0). The zero-*g* level tolerance (TyOff) describes the standard deviation of the range of zero-*g* levels of a group of sensors.

Zero-rate level describes the actual output signal if there is no angular rate present. The zero-rate level of precise MEMS sensors is, to some extent, a result of stress to the sensor and therefore the zero-rate level can slightly change after mounting the sensor onto a printed circuit board or after exposing it to extensive mechanical stress. This value changes very little over temperature and time (see [Table 3](#page-11-0)).

# **5.1 I²C/SPI interface**

The registers embedded inside the LSM6DSK320X may be accessed through both the I²C and SPI serial interfaces. The latter may be software configured to operate either in 3-wire or 4-wire interface mode. The device is compatible with SPI modes 0 and 3.

The serial interfaces are mapped to the same pins. To select/exploit the I²C interface, the CS line must be tied high (that is, connected to VDDIO).

**Pin name Pin description** CS Enables SPI I²C/SPI mode selection (1: SPI idle mode / I²C communication enabled; 0: SPI communication mode / I²C disabled) SCL/SPC I²C serial clock (SCL) SPI serial port clock (SPC) SDA/SDI/SDO I²C serial data (SDA) SPI serial data input (SDI) 3-wire interface serial data output (SDO) SDO/TA0 SPI serial data output (SDO) I²C less significant bit of the device address

**Table 10. Serial interface pin description**

# **5.1.1 I²C serial interface**

The LSM6DSK320X I²C is a bus target. The I²C is employed to write the data to the registers, whose content can also be read back.

The relevant I²C terminology is provided in the table below.

**Table 11. I²C terminology**

| Term        | Description                                                                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transmitter | The device that sends data to the bus                                                    |
| Receiver    | The device that receives data from the bus                                               |
| Controller  | The device that initiates a transfer, generates clock signals, and terminates a transfer |
| Target      | The device addressed by the controller                                                   |

There are two signals associated with the I²C bus: the serial clock line (SCL) and the serial data line (SDA). The latter is a bidirectional line used for sending and receiving the data to/from the interface. Both the lines must be connected to VDDIO through external pull-up resistors. When the bus is free, both the lines are high.

The I²C interface is implemented with fast mode (400 kHz) I²C standards as well as with fast mode plus (1000 kHz).

In order to disable the I²C block, I2C\_I3C\_disable = 1 must be written in [IF\\_CFG \(03h\)](#page-57-0).

**DSxxxxx** - **Rev 0.1 page 22/210**

**Digital interfaces**

#### <span id="page-22-0"></span>**5.1.2 I²C operation**

The transaction on the bus is started through a start (ST) signal. A start condition is defined as a high to low transition on the data line while the SCL line is held high. After this has been transmitted by the controller, the bus is considered busy. The next byte of data transmitted after the start condition contains the address of the target in the first 7 bits and the eighth bit tells whether the controller is receiving data from the target or transmitting data to the target. When an address is sent, each device in the system compares the first seven bits after a start condition with its address. If they match, the device considers itself addressed by the controller.

The target address (TAD) associated to the LSM6DSK320X is 110101xb. The SDO/TA0 pin can be used to modify the less significant bit of the device address. If the SDO/TA0 pin is connected to the supply voltage, LSb is 1 (address 1101011b); else if the SDO/TA0 pin is connected to ground, the LSb value is 0 (address 1101010b). This solution permits to connect and address two different inertial modules to the same I²C bus.

Data transfer with acknowledge is mandatory. The transmitter must release the SDA line during the acknowledge pulse. The receiver must then pull the data line low so that it remains stable low during the high period of the acknowledge clock pulse. A receiver that has been addressed is obliged to generate an acknowledge after each byte of data received.

The I²C embedded inside the LSM6DSK320X behaves like a target device and the following protocol must be adhered to. After the start condition (ST) a target address is sent, once a target acknowledge (TAK) has been returned, an 8-bit subaddress (SUB) is transmitted. The increment of the address is configured by the [CTRL3](#page-66-0) [\(12h\)](#page-66-0) (IF\_INC).

The target address is completed with a read/write bit. If the bit is 1 (read), a repeated start (SR) condition must be issued after the two subaddress bytes; if the bit is 0 (write) the controller transmits to the target with direction unchanged. Table 12 explains how the TAD+read/write bit pattern is composed, listing all the possible configurations.

**Table 12. TAD+read/write patterns**

| Command | TAD[6:1] | TAD[0] = TA0 | R/W | TAD+R/W        |

**Digital interfaces**

Data are transmitted in byte format (DATA). Each data transfer contains 8 bits. The number of bytes transferred per transfer is unlimited. Data is transferred with the most significant bit (MSb) first. If a target receiver does not acknowledge the target address (that is, it is not able to receive because it is performing some real-time function) the data line must be left high by the target. The controller can then abort the transfer. A low to high transition on the SDA line while the SCL line is high is defined as a stop condition. Each data transfer must be terminated by the generation of a stop (SP) condition.

In the presented communication format, CAK is controller acknowledge and NCAK is no controller acknowledge.

#### <span id="page-24-0"></span>**5.1.3 SPI bus interface**

The SPI on the LSM6DSK320X is a bus target that allows writing and reading the registers of the device.

**Figure 10. Read and write protocol (in mode 3)**

![](_page_24_Figure_7.jpeg)

**CS** enables the serial port and it is controlled by the SPI controller. It goes low at the start of the transmission and goes back high at the end. **SPC** is the serial port clock and it is controlled by the SPI controller. It is stopped high when **CS** is high (no transmission). **SDI** and **SDO** are, respectively, the serial port data input and output. Those lines are driven at the falling edge of **SPC** and should be captured at the rising edge of **SPC**.

Both the read register and write register commands are completed in 16 clock pulses or in multiples of 8 in the case of multiple read/write bytes. Bit duration is the time between two falling edges of **SPC**. The first bit (bit 0) starts at the first falling edge of **SPC** after the falling edge of **CS** while the last bit (bit 15, bit 23, ...) starts at the last falling edge of SPC just before the rising edge of **CS**.

**bit 0**: RW bit. When 0, the data DI(7:0) is written into the device. When 1, the data DO(7:0) from the device is read. In the latter case, the chip drives **SDO** at the start of bit 8.

**bit 1-7**: address AD(6:0). This is the address field of the indexed register.

**bit 8-15**: data DI(7:0) (write mode). This is the data that is written into the device (MSb first).

**bit 8-15**: data DO(7:0) (read mode). This is the data that is read from the device (MSb first).

In multiple read/write commands further blocks of 8 clock periods are added. When the [CTRL3 \(12h\)](#page-66-0) (IF\_INC) bit is 0, the address used to read/write data remains the same for every block. When the [CTRL3 \(12h\)](#page-66-0) (IF\_INC) bit is 1, the address used to read/write data is increased at every block.

The function and the behavior of **SDI** and **SDO** remain unchanged.

#### **5.2.3 Overview of antispike filter management**

The device acts as a standard I²C target as long as it has an I²C static address. The device is capable of detecting and disabling the I²C antispike filter after detecting the broadcast address (7'h7E/W). In order to guarantee proper behavior of the device, the I3C controller must emit the first START, 7'h7E/W at open-drain speed using I²C fast mode plus reference timing.

After detecting the broadcast address, the device can receive the I3C dynamic address following the I3C pushpull timing. If the device is not assigned a dynamic address, then the device continues to operate as an I²C device with no antispike filter. For the case in which the host decides to keep the device as I²C with an antispike filter, there is a configuration required to keep the antispike filter active. This configuration is done by writing the ASF\_CTRL bit to 1 in the [IF\\_CFG \(03h\)](#page-57-0) register. This configuration forces the antispike filter to always be turned on instead of being managed by the communication on the bus.

# <span id="page-32-0"></span>**6 Functionality**

This section describes all the operating modes and power modes of the LSM6DSK320X.

*Note: Refer to the product application note for the details regarding operating/power mode configurations, settings, turn-on/off time and on-the-fly changes.*

# **6.1 Operating modes**

In the LSM6DSK320X, the low-*g*, high-*g* accelerometers and the gyroscope can be turned on/off independently of each other and are allowed to have different ODRs and power modes.

#### **6.1.1 Low-***g* **accelerometer operating modes**

In the LSM6DSK320X, the accelerometer can be configured in six different operating modes: power-down mode, low-power mode (1, 2, 3), normal mode, high-performance mode, high-accuracy ODR mode, and ODR-triggered mode.

The operating mode selected depends on the value of the OP\_MODE\_XL\_[2:0] bits in [CTRL1 \(10h\).](#page-64-0)

If the value of the OP\_MODE\_XL\_[2:0] bits is 000 (default), high-performance mode is valid for all ODRs (from 7.5 Hz up to 7.68 kHz).

Normal mode is available for ODR values from 7.5 Hz to 1.92 kHz and it is enabled by setting the OP\_MODE\_XL\_[2:0] bits to 111. Normal mode cannot be used in mode 3 connection mode.

In high-performance mode and in normal mode, the analog antialiasing filter is active.

Low-power mode is available for lower ODRs (1.875 Hz, 15 Hz, 30 Hz, 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 240 Hz). The three lowpower modes are enabled by setting OP\_MODE\_XL\_[2:0] to 100 (LPM1), 101 (LPM2), 110 (LPM3).

High-accuracy ODR mode is available for ODR values from 15 Hz up to 7.68 kHz and it is enabled by setting the OP\_MODE\_XL\_[2:0] bits to 001. Refer to [Section 6.1.4: High-accuracy ODR mode](#page-33-0) for more details.

ODR-triggered mode is available for ODR values from 15 Hz up to 7.68 kHz and it is enabled by setting the OP\_MODE\_XL\_[2:0] bits to 011. Refer to [Section 6.1.5: ODR-triggered mode](#page-34-0) for more details

The embedded functions based on accelerometer data (free-fall, 6D/4D, tap/double-tap, wake-up, activity/ inactivity, stationary/motion, step counter, step detection, significant motion, tilt) and the FIFO batching functionality are supported in all modes.

#### **6.1.2 High-***g* **accelerometer operating modes**

In the LSM6DSK320X, the high-*g* accelerometer can be configured with different ODRs from 480 Hz up to 7.68 kHz.

When the high-*g* accelerometer is used, the low-*g* accelerometer must be configured in high-performance mode or in high-accuracy ODR mode. In these configurations, antialiasing is enabled. The ODRs are independent between the low-*g* and high-*g* accelerometers.

There are no limitations on the selectable operating mode of the gyroscope when the high-*g* channel is enabled.

**Table 21. High-***g* **accelerometer compatibility with low-***g* **accelerometer operating modes and ODRs**

| Low-g accelerometer modes | Low-g accelerometer ODR_XL | High-g compatibility |  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|--|
| High-performance          | All                        | Y                    |  |
| High-accuracy ODR         | All                        | Y                    |  |
| Low-power                 | All                        | N                    |  |
| Normal mode               | All                        | N                    |  |
| ODR-triggered             | All                        | N                    |  |

#### <span id="page-33-0"></span>**6.1.3 Gyroscope operating modes**

In the LSM6DSK320X, the gyroscope can be configured in six different operating modes: power-down mode, sleep mode, low-power mode, high-performance mode, high-accuracy ODR mode, and ODR-triggered mode.

The operating mode selected depends on the value of the OP\_MODE\_G\_[2:0] bits in [CTRL2 \(11h\)](#page-65-0).

If the value of the OP\_MODE\_G\_[2:0] bits is 000 (default), high-performance mode is valid for all ODRs (from 7.5 Hz up to 7.68 kHz).

Low-power mode is available for lower ODRs (7.5 Hz, 15 Hz, 30 Hz, 60 Hz, 120 Hz, 240 Hz) and it is enabled by setting the OP\_MODE\_G\_[2:0] bits to 101.

High-accuracy ODR mode is available for ODR values from 15 Hz up to 7.68 kHz and it is enabled by setting the OP\_MODE\_G\_[2:0] bits to 001. Refer to Section 6.1.4: High-accuracy ODR mode for more details.

ODR-triggered mode is available for ODR values from 15 Hz up to 7.68 kHz and it is enabled by setting the OP\_MODE\_XL\_[2:0] bits to 011. Refer to [Section 6.1.5: ODR-triggered mode](#page-34-0) for more details

High-accuracy ODR (HAODR) mode can be enabled to reduce the part-to-part output data rate variation. It supports both the low-*g*, high-*g* accelerometers and the gyroscope. When this mode is used for one sensor (accelerometers or gyroscope), the other sensor also has to be configured in high-accuracy ODR (HAODR) mode.

The main high-accuracy ODR features are:

- Noise level is aligned with high-performance mode
- The power consumption in HAODR mode depends on the selected ODR and on the enabled sensors. As an example, at ODR = 960 Hz in combo mode (low-*g* accelerometer + gyroscope) it increases 20 μA (typical) compared to high-performance mode. Refer to the application note for more details.
- The UI channel bandwidth can be selected through the gyroscope LPF1 and accelerometer HPF/LPF2 filters.
- When HAODR mode is enabled, it is applied to the UI low-*g*, high-*g* accelerometers, UI gyroscope, EIS gyroscope, and temperature. It is not applied to the OIS accelerometer/gyroscope channels.

*Note: HAODR mode has to be enabled / disabled when the device is in power-down mode.*

When HAODR mode is enabled, four different sets of ODRs are supported based on the configuration of the HAODR\_SEL\_[1:0] bitfield in the [HAODR\\_CFG \(62h\)](#page-102-0) register, as shown in the table below.

*Note: High-accuracy ODR mode is not compatible with the activity/inactivity functionality (motion/stationary can be used).*

#### <span id="page-34-0"></span>6.1.5 ODR-triggered mode

When ODR-triggered mode is enabled, a reference signal must be provided to the INT2 pin, and the device then automatically aligns (in frequency and phase) the data generation to the edges of the reference signal.

It supports the low-g accelerometer only, gyroscope only, and the combo of low-g accelerometer and gyroscope. When both the accelerometer and gyroscope are enabled, the user must configure the same ODR on both the accelerometer and gyroscope. It is not possible to select different ODRs for the accelerometer and gyroscope; if different output data rate values are set, the ODR configured for the gyroscope data is also applied to the accelerometer data.

The full-scale configurations are totally independent between the accelerometer and gyroscope and they can be set in any combination.

Note: ODR-triggered mode has to be enabled / disabled when the device is in power-down mode.

Note: When ODR-triggered mode is enabled, the 1100 configuration of the ODR\_XL\_[3:0] bits in register CTRL1 (10h)

and the 1100 configuration of the ODR\_G\_[3:0] bits in register CTRL2 (11h) cannot be used.

Note: ODR-triggered mode is not compatible with the EIS functionality.

#### <span id="page-39-0"></span>6.3 Enhanced EIS

The LSM6DSK320X offers advanced design flexibility for EIS applications: enhanced EIS functionality has a dedicated channel and processing with independent filtering.

Enhanced EIS main features:

- Enhanced EIS channel gyroscope data can be read over the primary interfaces through I<sup>2</sup>C / MIPI I3C<sup>®</sup> / SPI.
- EIS data are available in free-run mode in the output registers (UI\_OUTX\_L\_G\_OIS\_EIS (2Eh) and UI\_OUTX\_H\_G\_OIS\_EIS (2Fh) through UI\_OUTZ\_L\_G\_OIS\_EIS (32h) and UI\_OUTZ\_H\_G\_OIS\_EIS (33h)) by setting the G\_EIS\_ON\_G\_OIS\_OUT\_REG bit to 1 in the CTRL\_EIS (6Bh) register or in FIFO (by setting the G\_EIS\_FIFO\_EN bit to 1 in the FIFO\_CTRL4 (0Ah) register) with dedicated TAG and timestamp configurable using FIFO\_CTRL4 (0Ah).
- Enhanced EIS option is compatible with mode 3 selection. When EIS data-out are read from the output registers (setting G\_EIS\_ON\_G\_OIS\_OUT\_REG bit), data from the gyroscope OIS chain can be only read from the auxiliary interfaces.

When enhanced EIS mode is activated through the ODR\_EIS\_[1:0] bits in the CTRL\_EIS (6Bh) register:

- Gyroscope UI can be configured only in power-down mode, high-performance mode, or high-accuracy ODR mode.
- Gyroscope EIS full scale can be selected by using the FS\_G\_EIS\_[2:0] bits in the CTRL\_EIS (6Bh) register.
- Gyroscope EIS data rate selectable at 1.92 kHz or 960 Hz configurable through the ODR\_G\_EIS\_[1:0] bits in the CTRL\_EIS (6Bh) register.
- LPF\_EIS low-pass filter (refer to Figure 24) bandwidth selection can be configured through the LPF G EIS BW bit in the CTRL EIS (6Bh) register.

# <span id="page-40-0"></span>**6.4 OIS**

This section describes OIS functionality. There is a dedicated gyroscope and accelerometer DSP for OIS. The device also supports self-test functionality on the OIS side.

#### **6.4.1 Enabling OIS functionality and configuration options**

There are two different ways in order to enable and configure the OIS functionality:

- **Auxiliary interface full control**: enabling and configuration done from the auxiliary SPI / MIPI I3C®
- **Primary interface full control**: enabling and configuration done from the primary interface

The configurations that allow selecting these two different options are done using the OIS\_CTRL\_FROM\_UI bit in the [FUNC\\_CFG\\_ACCESS \(01h\)](#page-55-0) register as described in the following table.

**Table 24. OIS configurations**

| OIS_CTRL_FROM_UI | OIS configuration option                         |  |  |  |  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|
| 0                | Auxiliary SPI / auxiliary MIPI I3C® full control |  |  |  |  |
| 1                | Primary interface full control                   |  |  |  |  |

**DSxxxxx** - **Rev 0.1 page 41/210**

#### <span id="page-41-0"></span>*6.4.1.1 Auxiliary SPI and auxiliary MIPI I3C® full control*

This is the default condition of the device. The camera module is completely independent from the application processor as shown in Figure 25.

The auxiliary interface can configure OIS functionality through [IF2\\_INT\\_OIS \(6Fh\)](#page-120-0), [IF2\\_CTRL1\\_OIS \(70h\),](#page-121-0) [IF2\\_CTRL2\\_OIS \(71h\),](#page-122-0) [IF2\\_CTRL3\\_OIS \(72h\)](#page-123-0).

By default, writing using the auxiliary SPI and writing/reading over the I3C are enabled. The IF2\_SPI\_READ\_EN bit in the [IF2\\_CTRL1\\_OIS \(70h\)](#page-121-0) register must be set to 1 to enable reading over the auxiliary SPI. When IF2\_SPI\_READ\_EN is set to 1, the auxiliary I3C target is disabled also.

The primary interface can access the OIS control registers ([UI\\_INT\\_OIS \(6Fh\),](#page-108-0) [UI\\_CTRL1\\_OIS \(70h\)](#page-109-0), [UI\\_CTRL2\\_OIS \(71h\),](#page-110-0) [UI\\_CTRL3\\_OIS \(72h\)](#page-111-0)) in read mode.

#### <span id="page-42-0"></span>*6.4.1.2 Primary interface full control*

This option allows the application processor to configure all OIS functionalities from the primary interface. This option allows using embedded OIS data for both the main and front camera, connecting them to the application processor (eventually adding a context hub) as shown in Figure 26: the AP can also process the data before sending them to the cameras.

In order to place the device in this mode, the OIS\_CTRL\_FROM\_UI bit in the [FUNC\\_CFG\\_ACCESS \(01h\)](#page-55-0)  register must be set to 1 from the primary interface.

![](_page_42_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 26. OIS primary interface full control**

Then, the AP can configure OIS functionalities through [UI\\_INT\\_OIS \(6Fh\),](#page-108-0) [UI\\_CTRL1\\_OIS \(70h\)](#page-109-0), [UI\\_CTRL2\\_OIS](#page-110-0) [\(71h\)](#page-110-0), [UI\\_CTRL3\\_OIS \(72h\).](#page-111-0)

By default, writing with the auxiliary SPI and writing/reading over the I3C are enabled. When the auxiliary SPI is used, the IF2\_SPI\_READ\_EN bit in the [UI\\_CTRL1\\_OIS \(70h\)](#page-109-0) register shall be set to 1. The IF2\_SPI\_READ\_EN bit enables reading over the SPI interface and it also disables the auxiliary I3C interface (as shown in Figure 26 (b)). The auxiliary SPI can access the [IF2\\_INT\\_OIS \(6Fh\)](#page-120-0), [IF2\\_CTRL1\\_OIS \(70h\),](#page-121-0) [IF2\\_CTRL2\\_OIS \(71h\)](#page-122-0), and [IF2\\_CTRL3\\_OIS \(72h\)](#page-123-0) registers in read-only mode.

*Note: The OIS\_CTRL\_FROM\_UI bit is reset by the software reset procedure.*

# <span id="page-43-0"></span>**6.5 FIFO**

The presence of a FIFO allows consistent power saving for the system since the host processor does not need continuously poll data from the sensor, but it can wake up only when needed and burst the significant data out from the FIFO.

The LSM6DSK320X embeds 1.5 KB of data in FIFO (up to 4.5 KB with the compression feature enabled) to store the following data:

- Gyroscope
- Low-*g* accelerometer
- High-*g* accelerometer
- External sensors (up to four)
- Step counter
- Timestamp
- Temperature
- FSM events
- High-*g* accelerometer peak value
- MLC features, filters, and results
- SFLP output data (quaternion, gyroscope bias, gravity vector)

The applications have maximum flexibility in choosing the rate of batching for physical sensors with FIFOdedicated configurations: low-*g* accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature sensor batch rates can be selected by the user. Writing external sensors in the FIFO can be triggered depending on the sensor hub rate chosen or by an external sensor interrupt. The step counter can be stored in the FIFO with an associated timestamp each time a step is detected. The status of the FSMs when they are generating an interrupt event can be stored in the FIFO, as well as the long counter overrun event or the long counter value when a specific command is executed from one FSM, all associated with the timestamp value. The high-*g* accelerometer peak value detected from the high-*g*  peak tracking feature is stored in FIFO. Results from SFLP (quaternion, gyroscope bias, gravity vector) can be stored in the FIFO at the rate selected for the algorithm. Moreover, MLC features, filters, and results can be enabled to be stored in the FIFO. It is possible to select decimation for timestamp batching in FIFO with a factor of 1, 8, or 32.

The reconstruction of a FIFO stream is a simple task thanks to the FIFO\_DATA\_OUT\_TAG byte that allows recognizing the meaning of a word in FIFO.

FIFO allows correct reconstruction of the timestamp information for each sensor stored in FIFO. If a change in the ODR or BDR (batch data rate) configuration is performed, the application can correctly reconstruct the timestamp and know exactly when the change was applied without disabling FIFO batching. FIFO stores information of the new configuration and timestamp in which the change was applied in the device.

Finally, FIFO embeds a compression algorithm that the user can enable in order to have up to 4.5 KB data stored in FIFO and take advantage of interface communication length for FIFO flushing and communication power consumption.

The programmable FIFO watermark threshold can be set using the WTM[7:0] bits in the [FIFO\\_CTRL1 \(07h\)](#page-58-0)  register. To monitor the FIFO status, dedicated registers ([FIFO\\_STATUS1 \(1Bh\),](#page-74-0) [FIFO\\_STATUS2 \(1Ch\)\)](#page-74-0) can be read to detect FIFO overrun events, FIFO full status, FIFO empty status, FIFO watermark status, and the number of unread samples stored in the FIFO. To generate dedicated interrupts on the INT1 and INT2 pins of these status events, the configuration can be set in [INT1\\_CTRL \(0Dh\)](#page-62-0) and [INT2\\_CTRL \(0Eh\).](#page-63-0)

The FIFO buffer can be configured according to seven different modes:

- Bypass mode
- FIFO mode
- Continuous mode
- Continuous-to-FIFO mode
- ContinuousWTM-to-full mode
- Bypass-to-continuous mode
- Bypass-to-FIFO mode

Each mode is selected by the FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0] bits in the [FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)](#page-60-0) register.

**DSxxxxx** - **Rev 0.1 page 44/210**

#### <span id="page-44-0"></span>**6.5.1 Bypass mode**

In bypass mode [\(FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)\(](#page-60-0)FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0] = 000), the FIFO is not operational and it remains empty. Bypass mode is also used to reset the FIFO when in FIFO mode.

### **6.5.2 FIFO mode**

In FIFO mode [\(FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)\(](#page-60-0)FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0] = 001) data from the output channels are stored in the FIFO until it is full.

To reset FIFO content, bypass mode should be selected by writing [FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)\(](#page-60-0)FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0]) to 000. After this reset command, it is possible to restart FIFO mode by writing [FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)](#page-60-0) (FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0]) to 001.

The FIFO buffer memorizes up to 4.5 KB of data (with compression enabled) but the depth of the FIFO can be resized by setting the WTM[7:0] bits in [FIFO\\_CTRL1 \(07h\).](#page-58-0) If the STOP\_ON\_WTM bit in [FIFO\\_CTRL2 \(08h\)](#page-58-0) is set to 1, FIFO depth is limited up to the WTM[7:0] bits in the [FIFO\\_CTRL1 \(07h\)](#page-58-0) register.

### **6.5.3 Continuous mode**

Continuous mode [\(FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)\(](#page-60-0)FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0] = 110) provides a continuous FIFO update: as new data arrives, the older data is discarded.

A FIFO threshold flag [FIFO\\_STATUS2 \(1Ch\)\(](#page-74-0)FIFO\_WTM\_IA) is asserted when the number of unread samples in FIFO is greater than or equal to [FIFO\\_CTRL1 \(07h\)](#page-58-0) (WTM[7:0]).

It is possible to route the FIFO\_WTM\_IA flag to the INT1 pin by writing in register [INT1\\_CTRL \(0Dh\)](#page-62-0) (INT1\_FIFO\_TH) = 1 or to the INT2 pin by writing in register [INT2\\_CTRL \(0Eh\)](#page-63-0)(INT2\_FIFO\_TH) = 1.

A full-flag interrupt can be enabled, [INT1\\_CTRL \(0Dh\)](#page-62-0)(INT1\_FIFO\_FULL) = 1 or [INT2\\_CTRL \(0Eh\)](#page-63-0) (INT2\_FIFO\_FULL) = 1, in order to indicate FIFO saturation and eventually read its content all at once.

If an overrun occurs, at least one of the oldest samples in FIFO has been overwritten and the FIFO\_OVR\_IA flag in [FIFO\\_STATUS2 \(1Ch\)](#page-74-0) is asserted.

In order to empty the FIFO before it is full, it is also possible to pull from FIFO the number of unread samples available in [FIFO\\_STATUS1 \(1Bh\)](#page-74-0) and [FIFO\\_STATUS2 \(1Ch\)\(](#page-74-0)DIFF\_FIFO\_[8:0]).

### **6.5.4 Continuous-to-FIFO mode**

In continuous-to-FIFO mode [\(FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)\(](#page-60-0)FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0] = 011), FIFO behavior changes according to the trigger event detected in one of the following interrupt events:

- Single tap
- Double tap
- Wake-up
- High-*g* wake-up
- Free-fall
- D6D

When the selected trigger bit is equal to 1, FIFO operates in FIFO mode.

When the selected trigger bit is equal to 0, FIFO operates in continuous mode.

### **6.5.5 ContinuousWTM-to-full mode**

In continuousWTM-to-full mode (FIFO\_CTRL4 (0Ah)(FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0] = 010), FIFO behavior changes according to the trigger event detected in one of the following interrupt events:

- Single tap
- Double tap
- Wake-up
- High-*g* wake-up
- Free-fall
- D6D

When the selected trigger bit is equal to 0, FIFO operates in continuous mode with the FIFO size limited to the FIFO watermark level (defined by the WTM[7:0] bits in the [FIFO\\_CTRL1 \(07h\)](#page-58-0) register).

When the selected trigger bit is equal to 1, FIFO continues to store data until it is full.

**DSxxxxx** - **Rev 0.1 page 45/210**

### <span id="page-45-0"></span>**6.5.6 Bypass-to-continuous mode**

In bypass-to-continuous mode [\(FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)\(](#page-60-0)FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0] = 100), data measurement storage inside FIFO operates in continuous mode when selected triggers are equal to 1, otherwise FIFO content is reset (bypass mode).

FIFO behavior changes according to the trigger event detected in one of the following interrupt events:

- Single tap
- Double tap
- Wake-up
- High-*g* wake-up
- Free-fall
- D6D

### **6.5.7 Bypass-to-FIFO mode**

In bypass-to-FIFO mode [\(FIFO\\_CTRL4 \(0Ah\)\(](#page-60-0)FIFO\_MODE\_[2:0] = 111), data measurement storage inside FIFO operates in FIFO mode when selected triggers are equal to 1, otherwise FIFO content is reset (bypass mode).

FIFO behavior changes according to the trigger event detected in one of the following interrupt events:

- Single tap
- Double tap
- Wake-up
- High-*g* wake-up
- Free-fall
- D6D

### **6.5.8 FIFO reading procedure**

The data stored in FIFO are accessible from dedicated registers and each FIFO word is composed of 7 bytes: one tag byte [\(FIFO\\_DATA\\_OUT\\_TAG \(78h\),](#page-113-0) in order to identify the sensor, and 6 bytes of fixed data (FIFO\_DATA\_OUT registers from (79h) to (7Eh)).

The DIFF\_FIFO\_[8:0] field in the [FIFO\\_STATUS1 \(1Bh\)](#page-74-0) and [FIFO\\_STATUS2 \(1Ch\)](#page-74-0) registers contains the number of words (1 byte TAG + 6 bytes DATA) collected in FIFO.

In addition, it is possible to configure a counter of the batch events of accelerometer or gyroscope sensors. The flag COUNTER\_BDR\_IA in [FIFO\\_STATUS2 \(1Ch\)](#page-74-0) alerts that the counter reaches a selectable threshold (CNT\_BDR\_TH\_[9:0] field in [COUNTER\\_BDR\\_REG1 \(0Bh\)](#page-61-0) and [COUNTER\\_BDR\\_REG2 \(0Ch\)\)](#page-61-0). This allows triggering the reading of FIFO with the desired latency of one single sensor. The sensor is selectable using the TRIG\_COUNTER\_BDR\_[1:0] bits in [COUNTER\\_BDR\\_REG1 \(0Bh\).](#page-61-0) As for the other FIFO status events, the flag COUNTER\_BDR\_IA can be routed on the INT1 or INT2 pins by asserting the corresponding bits (INT1\_CNT\_BDR of [INT1\\_CTRL \(0Dh\)](#page-62-0) and INT2\_CNT\_BDR of [INT2\\_CTRL \(0Eh\)\)](#page-63-0).

In order to maximize the amount of accelerometer and gyroscope data in FIFO, the user can enable the compression algorithm by setting to 1 both the FIFO\_COMPR\_EN bit in [EMB\\_FUNC\\_EN\\_B \(05h\)](#page-128-0) (embedded functions registers bank) and the FIFO\_COMPR\_RT\_EN bit in [FIFO\\_CTRL2 \(08h\)](#page-58-0). When compression is enabled, it is also possible to force writing noncompressed data at a selectable rate using the UNCOMPR\_RATE\_[1:0] field in [FIFO\\_CTRL2 \(08h\)](#page-58-0).

Meta information about accelerometer and gyroscope sensor configuration changes can be managed by enabling the ODR\_CHG\_EN bit in [FIFO\\_CTRL2 \(08h\)](#page-58-0).

# <span id="page-62-0"></span>**9.11 INT1\_CTRL (0Dh)**

INT1 pin control register (R/W)

Each bit in this register enables a signal to be carried over INT1 when the MIPI I3C® dynamic address is not assigned (I²C or SPI is used). Some bits can be also used to trigger an IBI (in-band interrupt) when the MIPI I3C® interface is used. The output of the pin is the OR combination of the signals selected here and in [MD1\\_CFG](#page-101-0)  [\(5Eh\)](#page-101-0).

INT2 pin control register (R/W)

Each bit in this register enables a signal to be carried over INT2 when the MIPI I3C® dynamic address is not assigned (I²C or SPI is used). Some bits can be also used to trigger an IBI when the MIPI I3C® interface is used. The output of the pin is the OR combination of the signals selected here and in [MD2\\_CFG \(5Fh\)](#page-102-0).

Reserved registers must not be changed. Writing to those registers may cause permanent damage to the device. The content of the registers that are loaded at boot should not be changed. They contain the factory calibration values. Their content is automatically restored when the device is powered up.
